I'm in my mid 20s and looking for somewhere safe, walkable, and with those that are of similar age so I can hopefully go out and meet people and have an access to a lot of social opportunities.

I'm also working remotely so commuting is not a concern - although I will have a car to travel for client meetings.

Thanks so much!",Jersey City,"Close proximity to NYC, diverse neighborhoods, vibrant nightlife"

I'm in my mid 20s and looking for somewhere safe, walkable, and with those that are of similar age so I can hopefully go out and meet people and have an access to a lot of social opportunities. Affordability would be a mega plus but the rental market seems to disagree with me a little bit on that one. I'm also working remotely so commuting is not a concern - although I will have a car to travel for client meetings. Would really appreciate any recommendations of areas to check out as I will be making a trip out to the area in a few weeks! Thanks so much!",Passaic,"Strong arts and culture scene, close to several major universities"

We both work remotely and can work from anywhere. We are looking for homes/farms ~ 2500+ sq ft with more acreage (5+) for potentially owning horses and a bit of the off-grid feel.
