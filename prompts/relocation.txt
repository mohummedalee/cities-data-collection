I am making the move to New Jersey for a job promotion I recently received. I’ve pretty much lived in the Midwest most of my life and have limited knowledge and connections in NJ. I’m in my mid 20s and looking for somewhere safe, walkable, and with those that are of similar age so I can hopefully go out and meet people and have an access to a lot of social opportunities. Affordability would be a mega plus but the rental market seems to disagree with me a little bit on that one. I’m also working remotely so commuting is not a concern - although I will have a car to travel for client meetings. Would really appreciate any recommendations of areas to check out as I will be making a trip out to the area in a few weeks! Thanks so much!
Family moving from Northeast state to Alabama in the coming months. Son 1 will be attending college in AL so we have some skin in the game. We both work remotely and can work from anywhere. We are looking for homes/farms ~ 2500+ sq ft with more acreage (5+) for potentially owning horses and a bit of the off-grid feel. Schools are an obvious concern with son 2 (elementary) when looking at more rural areas. We grew up visiting the AL/FL beaches and we are looking forward to that again. We would prefer to be within reach of good hospitals, groceries, schools, etc. Any suggestions on areas that we should be focused on to research? and what challenges we may be faced with in those areas?
