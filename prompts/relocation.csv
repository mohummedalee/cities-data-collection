"I am making the move to New Jersey for a job promotion I recently received. I've pretty much lived in the Midwest most of my life and have limited knowledge and connections in NJ. I'm in my mid 20s and looking for somewhere safe, walkable, and with those that are of similar age so I can hopefully go out and meet people and have an access to a lot of social opportunities. Affordability would be a mega plus but the rental market seems to disagree with me a little bit on that one. I'm also working remotely so commuting is not a concern - although I will have a car to travel for client meetings. Would really appreciate any recommendations of areas to check out as I will be making a trip out to the area in a few weeks! Thanks so much!",NJ,https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/stkhrv/moving_to_new_jersey_need_advice_on_where_to_live/
"Family moving from Northeast state to Alabama in the coming months. Son 1 will be attending college in AL so we have some skin in the game. We both work remotely and can work from anywhere. We are looking for homes/farms ~ 2500+ sq ft with more acreage (5+) for potentially owning horses and a bit of the off-grid feel. Schools are an obvious concern with son 2 (elementary) when looking at more rural areas. We grew up visiting the AL/FL beaches and we are looking forward to that again. We would prefer to be within reach of good hospitals, groceries, schools, etc. Any suggestions on areas that we should be focused on to research? and what challenges we may be faced with in those areas?",AL,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alabama/comments/14ys31g/moving_to_alabama_cant_find_the_spot/
"Hi, me, my boyfriend and his mom are planning on moving from florida to ohio within a-few months but i haven't been able to find any towns suitable, i'm from clarksville ohio and moved to Florida very young. We are looking for a place very affordable, not just rent but cost of living, and the main reason we are going north is for more nature because florida is overpopulated and polluted, but every time i find an affordable town they barely have any parks or nature trailsüò≠ So if anybody reading this could leave some suggestions of some ohio towns with good nature and affordable-ness please let me know I've been looking for a monthüôèüèª",OH,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/15x5jky/which_ohio_town_would_be_best_for_me_to_move/
"My family and I are looking to move to MI next summer but we don't know exactly where in the state we want to live. We plan on visiting a handful of towns before we settle down in one. We are fortunate enough that we can work from just about anywhere, so we are pretty open about location but do have a few requirements. It needs to be near water, like walking/short bike ride to a lake or nice river, would like a smaller population less than 30.000 would be ideal, needs shopping near by, rent needs to be cheap, the cheaper the better, low on crime and no prisons nearby (one of the major reasons we are leaving our current town) has nice parks, hiking, fishing, etc. We are just looking for a nice community to raise our family. So, where would be your ideal place to live? What places stand out to you?",MI,https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/comments/9bxc1x/looking_to_move_to_mi_where_is_your_favorite/
