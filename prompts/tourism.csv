"Coming to Arkansas for family vacation, things to see and do? We originally decided we wanted to go to the Crater of Diamonds State park, and the birthplace of Bill Clinton, and check out Little Rock. What else should we see that I won't find on the top 10 lists on travel sites? 2 Adults and a 6 yr old boy who loves caves and rocks and dirt. The Adults enjoy history and nature. Thanks in advance for helping out a family of cheese heads from Wisconsin.",AK,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arkansas/comments/15zqoi/coming_to_arkansas_for_family_vacation_things_to/
"Hey, I'm a travel nurse living in Nashville now and I'm there until June. I've always wanted to visit Alabama but not really sure what are the must sees and dos?

"Things to do in Wisconsin for 3 days. I'm visiting Wisconsin around Milwaukee town in a few days with 2 older adults. What are the must to see / do things? Good restaurants to eat at and where would I find the CHEESE? The adults are active in physical health so no worry of a wheelchair. They like fun activities and love to explore and discover the cultural foods and life of a city.",WI,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/1c8psdd/things_to_do_in_wisconsin_for_3_days/
